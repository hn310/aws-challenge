2. To enable ALB forward request to port 8080 on EC2:
On Elastic Beanstalk, choose ALB, choose process rule with port 8080
(which mean ALB will forward request to port 8080 on EC2)

**IMPORTANT**: 
Use "/health-check" page for health check. Don't use main page because it will take long time to load (>30sec)

3. Note
3.1. Should create a health-check.html for health-check. If use directly application for health-check -> could intefere with delete/create table -> sometimes error
3.1. ACM is regional service.
3.2. Enable HTTPS on ALB
Add listerner rule: Redirect port 80 -> 443
On target groups: enable health check on port 8080 (since app runs on 8080)
